      "text": "Preface to the Tenth Anniversary Edition In 1857, John Ruskin wrote a small book called The Elements of Drawing. It\u2019s a primer, an introduction, a short history; but it\u2019s also a very individual essay, full of passionate bias. It speaks to both the ordinary art lover and the better-versed painter. Above all, it is a book about looking. Ruskin begins by urging his reader to study nature\u2014to study a leaf, say, and then to copy it in pencil. He includes his own drawing of a leaf. He moves from a leaf to a painting by Tintoretto: notice the brushstrokes, he says, see how he draws the hands, look at how he pays attention to the shading. Ruskin\u2019s authority comes not from his own authority as a draftsman, but from what his eye has seen and how well, and his ability to transmit that vision into prose. There are surprisingly few books like this about the art of \ufb01ction\u2014that might speak simultaneously to the common reader, the hungry writer, the student, and even the scholar. E. M. Forster\u2019s book of lectures, Aspects of the Novel , is deservedly famous, but it was written in 1927.",

      "text": "I admire the critical work of Milan Kundera, of Roland Barthes, of Viktor Shklovsky, but in different ways those writers also frustrate. Kundera is a novelist and essayist rather than a practical critic; occasionally we want his hands to be a bit inkier with text. Shklovsky and Barthes, two great twentieth-century critics of narrative prose, attend brilliantly to questions of style, to words, form, codes, metaphor, and imagery. But they thought like writers who had become somewhat alienated from creative instinct, yet who were drawn, like larcenous bankers, to raid again and again the very source that sustained them\u2014literary style. This was especially true in the case of Roland Barthes, who had a guilty love-hate relationship with novelistic realism: he was its greatest, most acutely hostile anatomist, but he couldn\u2019t stop returning to his source, to remind himself once more of all the ways it seemed fraudulent. Shklovsky and Barthes were formalist critics: they privileged formal literary questions over political, historical, or ethical ones. Like the",

The formalist is ideally very interested in matters of content, since the selection of content is always a formal dilemma. And the moralist is ideally very interested in formal devices, because these are truth-bearing devices, not just beautiful ones. Fiction is not only a music, though there has long been aesthetic tension over the slightly tormenting question of just how musical it should be. How stylish should the novel be?",

When this book was \ufb01rst published in 2008, it was sometimes seen as a defense of classic realism.

Of course \ufb01ction is both arti\ufb01ce and verisimilitude, and it isn\u2019t dif\ufb01cult to hold together these possibilities. How Fiction Works was not, in fact, the title I had originally chosen; it was The Nearest Thing to Life , from an essay by George Eliot on German realism, in which she says that \u201cArt is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.\u201d I like this phrase, because the great Victorian realist is being precise. Art isn\u2019t the same as life, but very close to it, and that apparently slight distance (\u201cnearest thing\u201d) is actually a canyon, the large distance of arti\ufb01ce.

Fiction has been invigorated in the last decade by a new energy around questions of realism.

They want to break the forms, do something different. The impulse isn\u2019t particularly new, though it\u2019s hardly invalidated by the lack of novelty. For a century or longer, the novel has been blamed, in repeated spasms of correction, for ossi\ufb01ed convention: for the paraphernalia of plot, the rigid doxology of \u201ccon\ufb02ict,\u201d development, epiphany, scene-setting, dialogue, and so on, and for the fraudulent transparency of realism.",

The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance \u2026 Austen\u2019s irony dances over this like the long-legged \ufb02y in Yeats\u2019s poem: \u201cwhere he had made a tolerable fortune.\u201d What is, or would be, a \u201ctolerable\u201d fortune?

Fitzgerald has established a comic contrast between the rapturous, self-absorbed, romantic dreamer, Fritz von Hardenberg (based on the German poet and philosopher, Novalis), and his friend, Karoline Just, who is sensible, sober, and humanly wise. In the gendered environment of late-eighteenth-century Prussia, Karoline\u2019s modest task is to be a domestic helpmate, while Fritz\u2019s grander, male role is to talk and explain: philosophy, science, poetry, and love. But the canny author, channeling her inner Jane Austen, observes this setup with an ironic eye. The two are talking in the kitchen: \u201cAll was confessed, he talked perpetually. Neither the sewing nor the forewinter sausage-chopping deterred him. As she chopped, Karoline learned that the world is tending day by day not towards destruction, but towards in\ufb01nity. She was told where Fichte\u2019s philosophy fell short.\u201d As the woman works, the man talks. But where, precisely, does the irony fall?

But if author and character get too separated, as in the Updike passage, we feel the cold breath of an alienation over the text, and begin to resent the over-\u201cliterary\u201d efforts of the stylist.",

English is clumsier, and we have to resort to \u201che was doing something\u201d or \u201che would do something\u201d or \u201che used to do something\u201d\u2014\u201cevery week he would sweep the road\u201d\u2014to translate recurrent verbs accurately. But as soon as we do that in English, we have given the game away, and are admitting the existence of different temporalities. In Contre Sainte-Beuve , Proust rightly saw that this use of the imperfect tense was Flaubert\u2019s great innovation. And Flaubert founds this new style of realism on his use of the eye\u2014the authorial eye, and the character\u2019s eye. I said that Updike\u2019s Ahmad, just walking along the street noticing things and thinking thoughts, was engaged in the classic post- Flaubertian novelistic activity.

The street may well be littered with children, but they cannot all be \u201cin tears\u201d all the time. Likewise the cycling youths and the walking milk girls, who are presented as part of the habitual furniture of the place. On the other hand, the tattered bills and the ground marked with the children\u2019s game are plucked by the author from their quiescence, and made temporally noisy: they \ufb02ash at us, suddenly, but they belong to a different time signature than the children and youths. 38 The more one looks at this rather wonderful piece of writing, the less it seems \u201ca slice of life,\u201d or a camera\u2019s easy swipe, than a very careful ballet.

Joyce\u2019s sentence is thus made up of two mysterious details\u2014the gift and its recipient\u2014with the latter posing as the answer to the former mystery. The comedy is all to do with our desire for thisness in detail, and Joyce\u2019s determination to merely pretend to satisfy it. Queen Victoria, like Falstaff\u2019s \ufb01ctional Kendal green, is represented as the detail that promises to illuminate the surrounding gloom; or, we might say, the fact that promises to ground the \ufb01ction. It does ground the \ufb01ction, in one sense: our attention is surely drawn to the concretion.

But what a lot it tells us about the two sisters, in just a handful of words! It is the kind of detail that speeds on our knowledge of a character: a state of mind, a gesture, a stray word. It pertains to human and moral understanding\u2014detail not as thisness but as knowledge. Joyce drops into free indirect style at the very end of the sentence, to inhabit the collective mind of the proper and snobbish old ladies, who are \u201ccaught\u201d thinking about their brother-in-law\u2019s status. Imagine if the line went: \u201cHe was their favourite nephew, Ellen and Tom\u2019s \ufb01ne son.\u201d The sentence would tell us nothing about the sisters. Instead, Joyce\u2019s point is that inside their own minds, in their private voices , they still think of their brother-in-law not as \u201cTom,\u201d but as \u201cT. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.\u201d They are proud of his attainment, of his substance in the world, even a little daunted by it.

This sudden capturing of a central human truth, this moment when a single detail has suddenly enabled us to see a character\u2019s thinking (or lack of it), can be a branch of free indirect style, as in the example above. But not necessarily: it may be the novelist\u2019s observation from \u201coutside\u201d the character (though it speeds us inside, of course). There is such a moment in The Radetzky March , when the old captain visits his dying servant, who is in bed, and the servant tries to click his naked heels together under the sheets \u2026 or in The Possessed , when the proud, weak governor, von Lembke, loses his control.

The special \ufb02icker of this book, the tint and the delicacy that make it seem hallucinatory, derive from the solidity with which Saramago invests a character who is \ufb01ctional twice over: \ufb01rst Pessoa\u2019s, then Saramago\u2019s. This enables Saramago to tease us with something that we already know, namely that Ricardo Reis is \ufb01ctional. Saramago makes something deep and moving of this because Ricardo also feels himself to be somewhat \ufb01ctional, at best a shadowy spectator, a man on the margin of things. And when Ricardo re\ufb02ects thus, we feel a strange tenderness for him, aware of something that he does not know , that he is not real. 71",

This is something like Saramago\u2019s question; but it is worth noting that he reaches his question by traveling in the opposite direction of those postmodern novelists who like to remind us of the meta\ufb01ctionality of all things. A certain kind of postmodern novelist (like John Barth, say) is always lecturing us: \u201cRemember, this character is just a character. I invented him.\u201d By starting with an invented character, however, Saramago is able to pass through the same skepticism, but in the opposite direction, toward reality, toward the deepest questions. Saramago asks, in effect: But what is \u201cjust a character\u201d? And Saramago\u2019s uncertainty is more searching than William Gass\u2019s skepticism, for in life we anxiously question our existence rather than deny it. In Saramago\u2019s novels, the self may cast only a shadow, like Ricardo Reis, but this shadow implies not the nonexistence of the self, but only its dif\ufb01cult visibility, its near invisibility, rather as the shadow cast by the sun warns us that we cannot look directly at it.

He speaks out aloud, he soliloquizes. The novel begins in the theater, and novelistic characterization begins when the soliloquy goes inward. The soliloquy, in turn, has its origins in prayer, as we can see from Greek tragedy, or from Book 5 of The Odyssey , or from the Psalms, or from David\u2019s songs to the Lord in 1 and 2 Samuel. Shakespeare\u2019s heroes and heroines still use soliloquy to invoke the gods, if not quite to pray to them: \u201cCome you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\u201d \u201cBlow, winds, and crack your cheeks!\u201d and so on.

The obvious one is that soliloquy does not have to be voiced, and can get closer to being true mental speech. The hero is released from the tyranny of necessary eloquence; he is an ordinary man. (This is just what Raskolnikov cannot bear.) Inner soliloquy can indulge in repetition, ellipsis, hysteria, vagueness \u2014mental stutter. If Shakespeare\u2019s characters often seem to be overhearing themselves when they soliloquize, 1 we are now overhearing Raskolnikov. There is no facet of his soul not tilted toward us. Something else worth noticing is that while David has no mind, to speak of, and Macbeth\u2019s mind is punished, Raskolnikov\u2019s mind is the author of its own woe; the idea of murdering the woman was his free invention.",

Surely it would be more effective to begin in the middle, and then move backward, and then move forward, and then move backward again?",

A certain group of people creates a certain kind of crowd\u2014there\u2019s an obvious difference between a cocktail party and a violent mob, or between two lovers going for a stroll and thousands of people waiting in Times Square for the New Year.

In similar ways, story is related to, and to some extent determines, form. And form to some extent determines story, just as crowds or parties can take on a life of their own, and drive the activity and mood of the individuals in that crowd.

First, by allowing them to acquire a wider vocabulary \u2026 Next, by granting of\ufb01cers the opportunity to acquire experience by proxy. \u201cA police of\ufb01cer must be worldly, and books enrich people\u2019s experience indirectly.\u201d Finally, Amador claims, there is an ethical bene\ufb01t. \u201cRisking your life to save other people\u2019s lives and property requires deep convictions. Literature can enhance those deep convictions by allowing readers to discover lives lived with similar commitment.",

It is no accident that the novel\u2019s rise in the mid-eighteenth century coincides with the rise of the philosophical discussion of sympathy, especially in thinkers like Adam Smith and Lord Shaftesbury. Smith, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), argues what is merely axiomatic today, that \u201cthe source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of others\u201d is mobilized by \u201cchanging places in fancy with the sufferer\u201d\u2014by putting ourselves in the other\u2019s shoes.",

The con\ufb02ict is resolved by nullifying one of its elements.

The \ufb01rst is by the novelist Rick Moody, writing in Bookforum : It\u2019s quaint to say so, but the realistic novel still needs a kick in the ass. The genre, with its epiphanies, its rising action, its predictable movement, its conventional humanisms, can still entertain and move us on occasion, but for me it\u2019s politically and philosophically dubious and often dull. Therefore, it needs a kick in the ass.",

Moody\u2019s three sentences ef\ufb01ciently compact the reigning assumptions. Realism is a \u201cgenre\u201d (rather than, say, a central impulse in \ufb01ction-making); it is taken to be mere dead convention, and to be related to a certain kind of traditional plot, with predictable beginnings and endings; it deals in \u201cround\u201d characters, but softly and piously (\u201cconventional humanisms\u201d); it assumes that the world can be described, with a naively stable link between word and referent",

History shows us, says Aristotle, \u201cwhat Alcibiades did\u201d; poetry\u2014i.e., \ufb01ctional narrative\u2014shows us \u201cthe kind of thing that would happen\u201d to Alcibiades. Hypothetical plausibility\u2014probability\u2014is the important and neglected idea here: probability involves the defense of the credible imagination against the incredible. This is surely why Aristotle writes that a convincing impossibility in mimesis is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility. The burden is instantly placed not on simple verisimilitude or reference (since Aristotle concedes that an artist may represent something that is physically impossible), but on mimetic persuasion : it is the artist\u2019s task to convince us that this could have happened. Internal consistency and plausibility then become more important than referential rectitude. And this task will of course involve much \ufb01ctive arti\ufb01ce and not mere reportage.",

This, we say to ourselves, is what it would feel like to be outcast from one\u2019s family, like an insect (Kafka), or a young madman (Hamsun), or an aged parent kept in a bin and fed pap (Beckett). There is still nothing as terrifying in contemporary \ufb01ction, not even in the blood-bin of Cormac McCarthy or the sadistic eros of Dennis Cooper, as the moment when Knut Hamsun\u2019s narrator in Hunger , a starving young intellectual, puts his \ufb01nger in his mouth and starts eating himself. None of us, I hope, has done this, or will ever want to. But Hamsun has made us share it, has made us feel it.

But in outwitting it, the artist is always establishing another dying convention. It is this paradox that explains the further, well-known literary-historical paradox, one we have witnessed through the course of this book, from Flaubert to Knausgaard, namely that poets and novelists repeatedly attack one kind of realism only to argue for their own kind of realism. It is summarized in Flaubert\u2019s remark about pornography: \u201cObscene books are immoral because untruthful. When reading them, one says, \u2018That\u2019s not the way things are.\u2019 Mind you, I detest realism, though I am claimed as one of its pontiffs.\u201d On the one hand, Flaubert wants nothing to do with the movement of \u201crealism\u201d; on the other, he deems certain books \u201cuntruthful\u201d because they do not depict things as they are. (Chekhov used a similar formulation when watching an Ibsen play: \u201cBut Ibsen is no playwright \u2026 Ibsen just doesn\u2019t know life. In life it simply isn\u2019t like that.\u201d) Thomas Hardy argued that art wasn\u2019t realistic because art is \u201ca disproportioning\u2014(i.e.",

These writers rejected mere photographic \ufb01delity, because art selects and shapes. But they revered truth and truthfulness.
